# Project 07: Which Telecom Plan Is Right For You?
 
**Objective:** To develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict for subscribers to the mobile carrier Megaline which of the two new plans (Smart or Ultra) they should switch to based on their phone and internet usage.

**Accomplishment:** To pass this project, the final model must acquire an accuracy score of at least 0.75. My final model, a random forest classifier, acquired a value of 0.82 on the test set.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Machine learning and model evaluation
